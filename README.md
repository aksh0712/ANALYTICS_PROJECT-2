Cyber-Security Network Intrusion Detection System.

Description: The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misuse-based detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based detection is generally favored in commercial products due to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research anomaly detection is typically conceived as a more powerful method due to its theoretical potential for addressing novel attacks.
